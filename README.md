# Neural-FCA

## Overview

This project applies Neural Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to classify acute inflammations in the urinary system, comparing its performance with traditional machine learning models.

## Dataset

We utilize the UCI Acute Inflammations Dataset for our analysis.

## Methods

- Neural FCA combines neural networks with formal concept analysis.
- Comparison models include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

## Results

Our findings highlight the effectiveness of Neural FCA in medical diagnosis through performance comparisons.
