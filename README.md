# Neural-FCA
The objective of this project was to apply Neural Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to the UCI Acute Inflammations Dataset for the classification of two urinary system diseases. We compared the performance of Neural FCA with several popular machine learning algorithms to evaluate its effectiveness in medical diagnosis tasks.
